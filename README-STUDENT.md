<h1 align="center">Lua 3d Renderer</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>A 3d rendering program written in the language lua</strong>
<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>Our project is a 3d renderer. We built it because we wanted to understand how other 3d renderers like opengl worked</strong><br/>
Answer these questions: What is your project? Why'd you build it?

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>Our main goal was to create a a game in 3d written in lua. A requirement that we set for ourselves was to create our own 3d renderer for the game, which eventually became the entire project because building a 3d renderer takes a lot of time and research due to complicated mathematics that are involved.

 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>Manage to render a cube in a 3d space</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>We learned how matrix multiplication works, and how displaying depth on a 2d plane involves fairly complicated math and concepts. We understood these concepts at the end of the project, which is what allowed us to project a cube that seems to be a 3rd dimensional object on a 2 dimensional screen.</strong><br/>
So... what did you learn? (start this, but **come back to it at the end of the sprint**)

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>To run this project, download the main.lua file, which is the only truely necessary file to allow the program to run. If you have lua and love2D installed, it should run properly, displaying a green cube on screen. If this doesn't happen, check if both lua and love2D are installed and make sure that they are up to date.</strong><br/>
How would I, or anyone who comes across this project, run this project? Make sure to include all the steps.
